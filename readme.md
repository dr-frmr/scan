#  Scan (name WIP): physically verify planet ownership

Scan is an Urbit app that allows you to prove ownership via a one-time QR code generated by your ship. This allows physical events to instantly verify attendees and create a secure and provable guest list, without any hassle. Combined with the EScape mobile app, Urbit ship owners can now easily confirm ownership. This property can be combined with other Urbit apps like %gora to create proof-of-attendance tokens, and will hopefully spawn future apps that make use of %scan to facilitate RSVP tools, party invites, and much more.
